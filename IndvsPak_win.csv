Hardik after doing it successfully for years finally started struggling for once in 2021 and most people did not back him at all, instead were happy with him not playing and making fun of him (look back at any Hardik post before his comeback). 

His personality wasn't even that bad to warrant such hate, the media made a huge deal of him than what it was, the dude just dared to say kind of stuff other cricketers were afraid to talk about to seem media/family friendly. 

Man worked on his own in the break without BCCI and ""fans"" advice and his comeback shows. ""Matureness"" aside performance wise he was up there as one of the most important players for India for LOI's and he deserved better backing."

*India will need 14 runs off the final over. Virat Kohli is batting on 70 of 53 balls in what has been a splendid performance.*

*Haris Rauf has an over to spare. Doesn’t matter. Inevitably Babar Azam calls up Hasan Ali and gives him the ball. Dread it, run away from it. Hasan Ali always bowls the crucial over.*

*The first 2 balls by Hasan are on the mark and Virat could score only 2 runs. The third ball, Hasan bowls a widish ball and Virat nicks off and Hasan jumps up in his classic backbreaker celebration. He massages his back as he seems to have hurt himself. But no matter.*

*As Kohli walks back, Shadab Khan runs from the boundary and punches Hasan Ali on the gut.*

*Babar on seeing that walks towards Shadab.*

Babar: I saw that you sucker-punched Hasan.

Shadab: Yes, I did.

Babar: But why?

Shadab: Yeah, well, because he took this wicket and you can see who is coming to bat.

Babar: [pause] Oh

*Babar goes to Hasan Ali*

Hasan : Why do you look angry Daddy Bobby?

Babar: It’s not what you did, Hasan, that angers me so. It’s who you brought to the crease by taking that wicket.

Hasan: Who? That fucking nobody. That bits and pieces player?

*Mohammad Rizwan who was with in earshot steps in.*

Rizwan: That “fuckin’ bits and pieces player”… is Ravindra Jadeja. He once knew somebody who knew somebody who was a vague associate of mine. They call him “Baba Yaga.”

Hasan: The Boogeyman?

Babar : Well Jadeja wasn’t exactly the Boogeyman. He was the one you sent to destroy the fucking Boogeyman.

Hasan : [stunned] Oh.

Babar : Do you know what is the maximum you can score off an over? A proper 6 ball over. Not the shit you see in the Hundred.

Hasan : 36?

Babar : He fuckin slayed the boogyman for 37 runs off the last over. He is Sir Baba Yaga.

Hasan: [stunned] Oh.

Babar: Jadeja is a man of focus, commitment, sheer will… something Umar Akmal knows very little about. I once saw a Twitter video where Jaddu hit 3 boundaries in a practice match… with his dick, with his fucking penis. Once big MSD made a deal with Jaddu in return for his finisher skills. He gave him an impossible task. A job no one could have pulled off. To score 2 runs to win off the last ball and win the game with a ball to spare. How the fuck can anyone pull this off? The performance Jaddu gave that day laid the foundation for T20 cricket. And then my dear Hasan, you take a wicket and bring him to the crease when 12 runs are required off 3 balls.

Hasan: Daddy Bobby, I can make this right.

Babar: Oh? How do you plan that?

Hasan: By finishing what I started.

Babar: [irritated, turning to Rizwan ] What the… did that chut hear a fucking word I said?

Hasan: Daddy Bobby, I can do this! Please!

Babar: [pulls Hasan close, talks into his ear] Hasan bhai ! Listen! Huh? Jaddu will come for you and score these 12 runs off 2 balls. Maybe even 1 ball and you will do nothing because you can do nothing, so get the fuck out of my sight!

*India wins the match with 3 balls to spare and Jadeja is called to recieve the MOM from Harsha*

Harsha: Evenin’, Jaddu.

Jadeja: Evenin’, Harsha. MOM award?

Harsha: MOM award.

*[looks over Jadeja’s shoulder, sees the carnage behind him]*

Harsha: You, uh, workin’ again?

Jadeja: No, I was just sortin’ some stuff out for the team.

Haraha: Ah, well... I’ll leave you be then. Good night, Jaddu.

Jaddu: Good night, Harsha

*Jaddu leaves the ground. Refuses to elaborate further.*

*After a long pause, Dwayne Bravo comes up out of nowhere to receive the MOTM award on behalf of Jaddu.*"

For whatever reasons off or on field, this is one of the most anticipated fixture of the cricket. Everyone wants to win.  That includes you and me and Babar and Rohit.

We shall be kind to ourselves and the players who work hard to give us this entertainment, and to each other. There is enough toxicity in the world, we need not add to it.

I think we need an initiative to get the umpires much more involved in the game whilst being accountable for their actions.

*Here's what we do:*  We have an audience poll every few overs where we decide punishments for incorrect decisions. Doesn't have to be something harmful. Just things like:

1. Breakdance for 1 min
2. Beatbox
3. 25 pushups followed by Misbah salute
4. Try and touch your tongue to nose.

This way we won't get angry at incorrect decisions. Infact we'll look forward to it.

ICC, your move."

> The whole build up to the Asia Cup, the talk has been that this is the hottest time of year in UAE (every Cricinfo article mentions that). Wasim Akram mentioned on comms that curator told him there's no dew this time of the year. 

> It was a clear case of one team being way better than the other. Afg batted and bowled better. Stop diluting their efforts by calling it ""toss cup"". Farooqi bowled well up top. SL were bad with the bat. Afghanistan were aggressive with bat and SL lost hope quickly as you'd expect with their relatively inexperienced bowling line up that had two debutants tonight.

In respect for his bowling, my words for him

""'m not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with bhubi. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to bhubi I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then they'll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love."

Nowhere did I see such poor batting and bowling that fucked up the plot and ensured Pak's win. My god the batting! It was like seeing a bunch of school kids being put in front of adults and then told to bat, with disastrous results. The same can be said for the bowling, the most pathetic I've seen in recent years. Go ahead and downvote me all you want, or challenge my opinion, but the bowling was terrible in letting Pak score and result in their victory. I am thoroughly disappointed in all of the XI selected and didn't have any faith in y'all even before the match, not sure about the rest of India.

Every rule in the entire game is geared towards maximizing the amount of chances that Dahani can have in the squad. He's great viewing. What a thrilling sportsman. Marnus is OK but I can't deal with all that weird leaving. Sometimes a whole game can pass without Dahani being selected! Can you imagine? I hardly ever get to sit and watch for eight minutes while Dahani takes his guard and resets six times, followed by getting bowled through the gate. If Marnus wants to compete he needs far more of it. Also, there's far too many runs scored by Marnus. He scores too many runs and go far too long without slowing the game down with massive gaps between bat and pad, and 4 missed straight deliveries. What Cricket needs to do is make Dahani's runs worth more, so more time is watching one guy play all day. Did you guys see the latest Pakistan vs Australia game? 2.93 runs per over to 3.27! Australia had no answer to Pakistan's tactics of not missing every ball that's on the stumps then asking the umpire to end play early for bad light. Its this level of tactical sophistication that is missing in Indian cricket, where as you rightly point out, its just a bunch of athletic guys trying to score runs against each other. Yawn.

But Dinesh Karthik, however, had answered third. Why you ask? When the first member of the centipede is fed, they will eventually defecate forcing the second member to ingest their feces. One could imagine that would be considered incredibly disgusting. As such, the second member would immediately vomit. After vomit travels into the first member's anus and up into their colon, they'll then pust another load into the second member's mouth even more disgusting than the last. The third member would never ingest the faeces of the second member as they will always vomit what the first member expels back into them. The third member of the centipede gets to chill while the first and second trade a volley of shitty barf with each other forever.

That's why I say his issues aren't technical. Because whenever he's applied himself and just played the bowling he's been more than just fine. He had a control percentage of over 90 percent during his first innings 40-odd in the WTC final. That was when the ball was jagging around and the bowling was at its peak. He was phenomenal against the pink ball in Adelaide. He was brilliant in two innings in Chennai. Brilliant, that is, until he got out. At the most crucial junctures of play, before Tea breaks or Stumps or at the beginning of the day's play, he got out.

Kohli can't play the fast bowling? Lol. What an uneducated take. Kohli can. In fact, that's the problem. He can. And he can play the way he wants to. He can play that cover drive. He can play it so well that he can hear the commentators screaming about it: ""What a shot, King Kohli creams it through the covers! Oh my God, what a player, I just creamed through my covers!"" He can hear the soundtrack. He can hear them scream his name in orgasmic delight.

So he'll play the patience game for a while and he'll be in control. He'll seem in control. But it's just a matter of time. He wants to feel bat on ball. He needs that cover drive. He wants the old soundtrack to play so bad. And there's that ball on 5th stump. The ball he's been leaving. That ball out there that he could plunder through the covers like the conquering warrior he is.

He's King Kohli. He's the phenom. He's the limelight player. He's chipped one to long off."

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to kumar. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.

12670|Cricket|wzuuu9|im4hxh9|sshhaasshhaannkk|6|1661692798.0|"JHARKHAND DOES NOT EXIST. LEARN THE TRUTH.

Have you guys ever seen someone from Jharkhand? Have you ever been to Jharkhand or know a person who has been to Jharkhand? Yeah, I didn't think so.

Jharkhand is a conspiracy created by cricketer M.S Dhoni in order to hide the fact that he is a Pakistani. He saw the state of Pakistani cricket and really wanted to play in the IPL, but could not because he was from Pakistan. So at the age of 17 his parents smuggled him inside a carton of heroin attached to a drone flying over the border. He was dropped in Uttar Pradesh where he met his friend Shoab Malik, Sania Mirza's husband who he married for whatever the Indian equivalent of a green card is. Shoab Malik dropped him off at the cricket ground where recruitment was happening without realising that Dhoni was high due to smelling the Heroin fumes. 

Dhoni when reporting to the recruiters was asked where he was from and his brain panicked. His hands started sweating and his legs started feeling weak because he had forgotten his cover story, which was that he is a guy called Sachin Tendulkar from Maharashtra. On the spot he managed to make up a story about his life and told the recruiters that he was from Jharkhand. The recruiters, who were from South India, thought that it must just be another one of those North Indian states and thought it was normal. He played well and with the help of the rat controlling him under his cap (the rat was the spirit of Kapil Dev, who died earlier and is currently a clone, that is a different story I will tell later) won easily and got selected. However he felt bad that he was unable to use his Sachin Tendulkar cover and gave it to his Bangladeshi friend, who also joined him in a career of professional cricket. 

And that is the story of Jharkhand. Don't belive me? Tell me another thing from Jharkhand. Can only think of Dhoni? Yeah, I though so. Don't let the deep state lie to you anymore. Jharkhand is fake, it's simply not real."

Yes,it was scratchy but so is everyone when they were batting in this pitch. People wanted to bat him like SKY and so on, who got out with a much less score and similar strike rate. 

He can do so much better , and he could have easily converted it to a big score like he did a lot of times in the past. But look, this is a guy who people wanted out of the team, who looked terribly out of touch  ,  who is coming out of a break. He gave his best and scored something. At the end of the day you have to pat him on the back and give a second chance.

He 's like this insanely talented guy who is also super dumb. When he is on song ,he looks like God. But he is so dumb that, all the time does something stupid and gets out.  The moment Kohli stops doing these stupid mistakes , he might return to his old self. That guy still has it, you can see it in his shots."

13784|Cricket|wzuuu9|im4ptb2|apocalypse-052917|3|1661696621.0|There was this text based video game I used to play some years ago. Whenever I selected Pakistan, I used to immediately replace Sarfaraz Khan with Mohammed Rizwan. Cause Rizwan had the skill set I liked and potential to improve. Later I learnt how Sarfaraz was looked up as a leader and held immense legitimacy and respect for winning a ICC Trophy. But then I went with the media hyperbole and thought he was not worth it. I always kept note of Rizwan as a result. I became an admirer the moment he kept upto the stumps for Mohammed Abbas in England, August 2020. Abbas was swinging it around hoops at 125-130 Ks and Rizwan stood almost at a spinner's runup length from the wicket to keep. He did pretty well at that. He went on an exceptional run since then in New Zealand and Australia. I tuned into every performance of his. He did well for himself in LOI Cricket too along the way. I guess winning the PSL too. I checked out the recent PSL just for him. Then came the latest T20 World Cup and I found myself rooting for him. I wanted him to make a name for himself he thoroughly deserved. The man's crazy. I love these type of players in team sport who rely on their physical and mental attributes over technical ones. Rizwan is an appropriate representation of that type in Cricket. He is fit as a fiddle and intelligent. His conduct emanates smartness. My only grumble would be of him being a religious fundamentalist. Because of my personal disdain for proponents of religion. But that's besides the point. I love that he is a deeply intuitive thinker and extremely energetic. Hypothetically I believe he is the perfect replacement for MS Dhoni as CSK captain. I haven't been enthralled by a Pakistani Cricketer this much since perhaps Younis Khan, Misbah Ul Haq. Before that would be way back with possibly Shoaib Akhtar. Rizwan has that superstar quality, aspect about him. He captures attention in a way Babar Azam doesn't

Especially with a rusty Top 3 - Rohit not in the best of form, Rahul just returning from injury and an off form Kohli coming back from a break, this is quite a brave lineup to go with 6 bowling options. Not quite sure if it’s the right call to drop an extra batsman to go with Avesh, given how expensive he has been in recent times."

Nowhere did I see such poor batting and bowling that fucked up the plot and ensured Ind's win. My god the batting! It was like seeing a bunch of school kids being put in front of adults and then told to bat, with disastrous results. The same can be said for the bowling, the most pathetic I've seen in recent years. Go ahead and downvote me all you want, or challenge my opinion, but the bowling was terrible in letting India score and result in their victory. I am thoroughly disappointed in all of the XI selected and didn't have any faith in y'all even before the match, not sure about the rest of Pakistan

It was actually sad to see Pak pacers giving their heart and body out in each ball and then collapsing immediately due to stress. We had our 20 overs done by 6 bowlers, and our (technically) sixth bowler took 3 wickets (before winning the match with bat too)."

Taking only the runs into account, India would still need 9 off 2 at the end there, and I think we win that honestly (just would have needed one ball).

That said, we deserved to lose simply because of how Kushdil and Asif batter, and Ifthikhar wasn't much further behind.

His performance has been down for a while but today was far better than others from both sides of the game. Look at what happened to Babar and KL. I think the weather and wicket weren't great today which challenged the both teams. But, as Rohit mentioned in his post-match presentation, I'd enjoy a close game over a onesided one.

From KKR's point of view, this has to be their biggest loss – letting go (of) Suryakumar Yadav. Because someone you groom for four years and then you let him go.

24035|Cricket|wzuuu9|im5u5s2|brahhJesus|2|1661713216.0|Nothing serious like being a time traveller. Around '17-18 during a chat  in office I mentioned that Pandya would be captain someday and got laughed at. That started a joke where I'd always refer to him as My captain. My point is it was a guess not one purely out of intuition, more from a sense of how these things go. He always was a people person, had the self-belief and a knack for doing little extra-ordinary. You expect such players to grow with time, and when they do it looks so good, ala Ben Stokes, Kapil Dev, Imran Khan. I know this is pre-mature comparison but the template is there. But I never expected him to be as good a bowler as he has become, I thought he'd be batting 4-5 and making and winning games one day, not just winning. Now he seems to be on track of doing that with both bat and ball.
24036|Cricket|wzuuu9|im5rxw4|EmuCute7297|-5|1661712302.0|Back then I just had this hunch cuz the guy oozes confidence. His talent and skills now well proven, about time to move on from 3 perpetual chokers sharma kl kohli. Always scared and pissing in big games.

Sharma Kohli need to sort out their saas bahu kalesh outside. Don't ruin the team. And KL needs to be kept from intl cricket. Most overrated dud ever."

24039|Cricket|wzuuu9|im5rgxj|No-Avocado-4833|3|1661712107.0|its a cricket forum primarily for Pakistani cricket fans (hence the name pakpassion). it has some Indian posters as well, overall its a fun read with relatively minor  sprinkling of  jingoism, anti india/hindu sentiments. For some reason they lock their forum to guests (i.e you don't have an account registered)  every time either if Pakistan loses to India or if they loss  against a minnow .locked as in you can't read the threads, all you get is a login page .  I don't really see the logic. I don't have an account registered there, all  I can do is read their discussions , what would they gain from locking out someone like me  :)

24767|Cricket|wzuuu9|im5to38|pmp2301|3|1661713016.0|I know you’re not the same user who asked me to explain! But it felt like Indian team handled ups and down much better. Even their bench/dugout?(idk what term is used for a place where players and coaches sit) was calm. They didn’t look nervous. On the other hand Pakistani team did show lots of heart but they started panicking at every up and down. Every fielding mistake sent them spiralling. They didn’t look in charge even first wicket was at one run. India as a whole coaches and players looked calm and Pakistan as whole looked bit nervous. That’s the vibe I got from this game. I might be wrong though as I am not regular cricket viewer and don’t know cultural/ game subtleties or nuances but I do watch lots of sports and teams. Hope this explains my stance!

On Pant he has not set the world alight in T20I but of late his struke rate has certainly got way better and ofcourse his intent."

He does not.

> given the past performance beyond a year or so. 

Lol, what? You clearly haven’t seen his recent performances. He has been in bad form for years now. Is he not? Or you’re being totally ignorant as his fan? 

> I don't expect a thunderstorm innings. Even if he makes 5(5), I couldn't care less. 

Wow, this just proves your bias toward Virat. Virat being in the playing 11 **replaces a potential talent who can perform better**. Why would you not care less  if he scores 5(5)? He is occupying a damn space as a full-fledged bastman in a very important match, obviously he should perform. You think he deserves to be in the playing 11, and still be fine if he goes 5(5) shows who is the actual brain-dead here.

> If we started having a team of experienced player with good immediate records, we'll never have a playing XI.

Someone who is in hot immediate form would perform a lot better than someone who was once in form 5 years ago."
