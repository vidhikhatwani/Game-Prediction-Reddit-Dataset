So can't really say we did well today

My problem was the playing 11

How the fuck Rohit thought playing Bhuvi at 8 followed by 3 number 11s was right? 

And why Hooda didn't bowl a single over even when Hardik and Chahal were going for runs?

If you want to play with Intent‚Ñ¢ you need Batdeep 

Atleast they should have played Ashwin over Chahal

Chahal is pretty much a bowler who gives you 1-40 or 3-35 he often goes for a lot of runs 

Chahal didn't got shit but he was wicketless against Hong Kong the same team which collapsed against Pakistan's spinners.

Arshdeep is great find and he bowls best when he is under pressure his catch drop was costly but Bhuvi's 19 th over killed all the chances we had. 

Bhuvi is great and he proves himself again and again but his batting is useless in T20s and he needs to get his shit together or his place might be under threat as Arshdeep is really making a case for him. 

I hope so Rohit picks proper playing 11 in the next game and enough chances for Yuzi imo.

Apart from all this I am a fan of Rizwan now. Dude just doesn't give up. Nawaz was a surprise and Rauf bowled much better than his numbers suggest. Hope so both teams meet again in the final!"

Seriously tho both captains used their bowlers well good field changes etc.This was some touch notch cricket.

Rizwan/babar need to change their strategy of anchor playing till 16th over since we have good depth now hand both rizwan and babar have shown they can accelerate. India on the other hand I think missed the trick by not playing DK feel like he would have dominated hussnain and naseem at the end

Pros for India:

* Incredible powerplay
* Great strike rates
* Kohli masterclass
* Overall Good bowling

Cons for India:

* Not enough batsman at end (No DK)
* Need to use 6th bowling option better

Overall India did well, dew didn't come in so very even conditions overall. It was literally just being outplayed (Rauf last over, powering hitting Kumar)"

2745|Cricket|x5lyrw|in3v1sj|AlbusDT|23|1662327650.0|"Some observations and learnings from today's match:  

1. Arshdeep is a fantastic bowler. But he isn‚Äôt the best short 3rd man fielder. He missed a couple of chances today (not counting the drop catch), and was late on the ball every time. 

2. We need DK in the 11. An in form finisher is non-droppable. 

3. If he isn‚Äôt going to bowl, Hudda doesn‚Äôt earn a spot in the 11. 

4. For Hardik, the shortball has to be a surprise. Pakistanis were ready for it today."
2746|Cricket|x5lyrw|in4gzk0|Thatguy1126|24|1662337861.0|"Since this is still on top of r/all. I want to add my comment too now.

I know hindsight but all great limited overs teams have at least 6, ideally 7 bowling options. 1-2 of your bowlers are bound to have an off day like Hardik. India is just too rigid with 5 bowlers approach.
It was clear after first inning that spinners will dominate on this pitch, There was a leftie on crease for much of Pak innings and that's why I think Hooda should have bowled an over or two, what is the the point of playing him if he is not gonna bowl. Might as well have played Karthik instead of Hooda then, Karthik has a proven record against high quality pace.
My ideal 11 would have at least 6 and ideally 7 bowling options, can't expect Hardik to bowl his full quota everytime.
India need to include and bowl Hooda and/or Axar."

181 was a good score, even got 7 extra runs.

India fielded well. Bowling was good, bisnoi, Kumar, even arshdeep. 

Pakistan just batted well, they managed to get power hitters in properly and nawaz.

He met a dealer on the pretext of selling his home. He became good friends with the dealer and gained his trust. He slyly wrote a statement that transferred the curse to the dealer while signing the agreement for selling the house. Koach and Babar are in a similar situation.

I know these same people would have the opposite take if something different had occurred. These pond scum have clearly never watched a international match before and clearly are IPL fans, which as we all know are for children, women, the mentally incapacitated, the weak willed, gypsies, homosexuals and other undesirables.

Relax, peasants. I am here to tell you that a solid partnership is feeble compared to the massive total and it is highly unlikely that a chase will be easily completed. To do that the other team will need to score an unprecedented number of runs, whilst avoiding losing wickets to an unprecedented extent in less  overs. I read in the Art of Cricket that t20 cricket is all about swings in momentum and not every match is decided in three or four overs. Heed my advice, for I have level of understanding you could never hope to achieve.

I know that nobody else could possibly be jokingly exaggerating every event in the match or trying to make fans of the the losing team feel hopeful or attempting to look like a genius in case the crazy predictions do actually come true. Such things never happen in¬†r/cricket¬†match threads.

I am the only level-headed person here. I am a paragon of rationality and immune to your pathetic mood swings.

So, despite the good final over I still Arshdeep is going to get a dressing down in the dressing room (pun intended). In crunch T20 WC games catches are going to be crucial. Imagine Misbah being dropped at fine leg in the first T20 WC. 

That said, overall a good game. Bowling was good. They said it was 200 pitch and dew will hamper the spinners. Despite all that it went down to the last over and close. So I find it strange that people bemoaning ""weak bowling""."

Kohli: Washed up player living on 2 good knocks a year and advertising money.

Suryakumar: Budget AB De Villiers with a cringe acronym nickname, who sucks against the might of  the world‚Äôs best side Pakistan.

Pant: Red ball bully who can only smack bald spinners and is hopeless at succeeding in the true form of the game.

Pandya: A no-rounder only capable of bowling short balls and smacking length balls. Far inferior to the likes of true 3D players like Vijay Shankar.

Hooda: Frauded his way into the national squad by smacking Irish bowlers on a pitch with 30m boundaries. His bowling also makes Narine‚Äôs look legal.

Bhuvneshwar: Has the looks of a model, fitness of a 45 year old man.

Arshdeep: Trundler selected just because he bowls with his left hand and doesn‚Äôt get carted in the IPL

Bishnoi: Googly merchant who rose to fame by bullying teenagers who can‚Äôt play spin in U19s.

Chahal: Did you pluck him out of the 90s? Because he can‚Äôt field or bat to save his life. (Imo he should get a six if he clears the inner circle)

India is lacking a proper pace bowling lineup now.. 130-135 kmphr isn't gonna do much in Australia.. need to bring in some actual fast bowlers instead of medium pacers who can bowl slower balls..

we need strike bowlers like other teams have..
the only one which we got is bumrah others are just relying on some pace variation to trick the batmen into forcing a false shot..

current bowling lineup

bumrah ( strike bowler)

avesh Khan ( run machine)

bhuvi (highly dependent on early Swing)

arshdeep (dependent on variations )

shami ( strike bowler but not part of t20 wc)

deepak chahar ( same as bhuvi)

prasidh Krishna (good pace but can get wayward)

The captain should have different Plans and have the dynamism to see and change if something is not working. One thing should be clear, that if you don't perform you will be dropped no matter what your pedigree. I simply fail to comprehend that, with the amount of cricket played on a per capita basis, how is India not able to produce a more consistent cohort/pool of players that can come in and start firing away? The sheer amount of cricket that gets played in this cricket and the pool available at the grassroots level should be more than the entire population of some of these countries.

It just doesn't compute."

People who have been watching cricket for longer periods of time knows exactly that Asif Ali needs to get a lot better. He has a set role in the team i.e to get 20/25 quick runs at a s.r of 150 plus. He isn't even doing that every 5 matches, which is bad. Even today, luck was on his side otherwise it would have been curtains for us. So obviously, the man needs to work a lot on himself before he is called an established finisher. We keep playing him because we don't have anyone else.

3. High catches usually make one stand and wait and that can make one lose that focus on the ball.

But giving 19 runs as an experienced death bowler is not acceptable at all."

But would you have respected him less, if he asked of the Indian team to use their review?

Like I don't understand this, do you think ill of guys who appeal unnecessarily? What about mankads without warnings?

I'm of the view do everything within the rules.

The umpire is standing there in perfect view of everything to make a decision, focus on your batting, leave the decision to the umpire. If he gives you out, either review or walk, else stay there, let the fielding team use their review. When the umpire mistakenly gives you out, the fielding team won't come up to you and tell you, ""oh you should review it because impact is outside the stumps or it's missing leg"".

Imo you honour the sport best by doing your absolute best to win it within the rules."

18336|Cricket|x5lyrw|in32uja|jjack0310|5|1662315695.0|0 sympathies. He dropped a simple catch which could have given him more runs to defend

18338|Cricket|x5lyrw|in2xznf|Fuzzy-Ebb-3765|2|1662313730.0|maybe because arshdeep dropped the simplest catch you can get which caused asif to get another chance? bhuvi also garbage too

Kartik would have been a brilliant asset when India's run rate was flagging in the second half of the innings. Hooda would have been useful as well as a bowler , once Hardik had leaked quite a few in his first couple overs when everyone else has been economical , perfect time to give Hooda the ball and open up options for the end of the innings. All said and done, i would personally have Kartik in the 11 every chance I get given his current form.

Pakistan need 100 from the remaining 12 overs which means they've got to take at least 8.5 an over. Arshdeep and Bishnoi are going for 5 and 4 respectively.

If the front foot of a bowler lands behind the crease and slides beyond, then it is not a no-ball. If the foot lands beyond the crease, it is a no-ball. It is legal for a spin bowler, for example, to land with his toe spikes grounded wholly in front of the crease but to have his heel in the air behind that line"

Would have been different if Hooda had bowled after Hardik conceded too much in his first two overs because thay would, to some extent, justify Hooda coming in place of Jadeja and Pant coming in place of DK as a left handed batter. 

But the way we played today practically meant, Pant came in place of Jadeja as a replacement left handed batter and Hooda came in for DK as a finisher."

22294|Cricket|x5lyrw|in32wyo|thefastestindian|1|1662315724.0|Pak definitely deserves credit for converting those singles to doubles. India fielding relied on the target score too much rather than keeping fielding tight from the get go. It‚Äôs the mindset.

22299|Cricket|x5lyrw|in1wx9j|Into_The_Multiverses|1|1662298837.0|Yeah I do understand that. But the problem is why even start with DK only to drop him. Pant has been mediocre. DK had a great IPL but his T20Is were similar to Pants. But if you're starting with DK, just stick with him no. Pant shldnt get the start just cause he's a lefty.

23534|Cricket|x5lyrw|in2sjbe|noobmax_pro|1|1662311597.0|"Well there are formats in this game this one is 20-20 or T20 basically each team is given 20 overs to get whatever score they can. Now what's an over each over has 6 balls so each team gets 120balls to play(if they manage to not lose all the ten wickets before playing them)
There is another called ODI which is basically 50-50 and there is test match which is bit different from these two"
23535|Cricket|x5lyrw|in2t020|EnvironmentalRuin129|2|1662311783.0|Ah, so basically it determines length of matches.  Makes sense.
23536|Cricket|x5lyrw|in2t9id|noobmax_pro|1|1662311886.0|Right this one typically last around 3-4 hours, ODI one is like around 8+ and the test lasts 5 days around 40 hours!
