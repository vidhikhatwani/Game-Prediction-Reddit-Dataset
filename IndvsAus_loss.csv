Dear Diary,

We are in India! We are going to be playing some cricket to help us all get ready for the T20 World Cup next month. It is very exciting because we get to play with our India friends, like Rohit and KL and my special batting friend Virat! Virat is very good at playing T20s and he even scored a century when he last played T20 cricket. I gave him a big hug when I saw him because I knew that he was worried that he would never be able to make a century again, but now he has and he is feeling happy. Virat said to me that ‚ÄúNow I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, like if the Greek God Atlas was told that he could take a rest from carrying the Earth. Although, now I‚Äôve got the weight of 72 weighing over me now, so I suppose it‚Äôs like if Atlas was told that he didn‚Äôt have to carry the Earth, and could instead carry one of the lighter planets, like Mars or something. But still, I guess this is better. I mean, I hope this is better. Do you think it‚Äôs better Steve?‚Äù I told him that it was better, because he still gets to play cricket with his friends like me, and then I gave him a big hug. I like playing with Virat because he wants to score lots of runs, just like me!

Bye!"

Not good captaincy from Brohit with very random decisions with the bowlers.
Axar picked up a wicket so keep him going and atleast give him a two over spell. It's funny because I've seen Brohit back his bowlers at MI for years now and keep them going if he think they can get him more.
Terrible fielding, I haven't seen a worse Indian side in the field for sometime now. And individually they're all good fielders but for some reason they just keep dropping catches.

Powerplay Bowling: Both have prodigious swing and are excellent in the Powerplay. Bhuvi‚Äôs more economic, while Chahar can run riot when he gets it right (multiple 4 wicket hauls in the powerplay alone) 

Middle Overs: Eh, nothing much to separate the two of them.

Death overs: Chahar > Bhuvi, at least based on current form. Bhuvi should be nowhere near the death overs given how many games he‚Äôs lost India now.

Batting: Chahar >>>>> Bhuvi. Can‚Äôt emphasize this enough, India already has an issue with their batting depth if Bhuvi is their T20 No.8 batsman. Chahar can at least provide a batdeep option for this Indian lineup.

Every time I come into these match threads, I see low IQ cretins having meltdowns when the opposition puts up the tiniest bit of resistance to their team who is otherwise dominating the match. I know these same people would have the opposite take if something different had occurred. These pond scum have clearly never watched a t20 before and clearly are the hundred‚Ñ¢ fans, which as we all know are for children, women, the mentally incapacitated, the weak willed, gypsies, homosexuals and other undesirables.

Relax, peasants. I am here to tell you that a solid partnership with a good run rate is more important compared to a couple of wickets  and it is highly unlikely the batting team will collapse. To do that the other team will need to take an unprecedented number of wickets , whilst avoiding giving away runs to an unprecedented extent. I read in the Art of Cricket that t20 cricket is all about swings in momentum and not every match is decided in three or four overs. Heed my advice, for I have level of understanding you could never hope to achieve. 

I know that nobody else could possibly be jokingly exaggerating every event in the match or trying to make fans of the the losing team feel hopeful or attempting to look like a genius in case the crazy predictions do actually come true. Such things never happen in [r/cricket](https://www.reddit.com/r/cricket/) match threads.

I am the only level-headed person here. I am a paragon of rationality and immune to your pathetic mood swings.

Truly, we can find few other batsmen with those elite stats, and when you add in the fact that he's on par with Ian Healy as a keeper (yet this gets mysteriously swept under the rug), it's inexcusable he doesn't get more matches.

He's had some off games, but that's T20 cricket...

I don't think his ideas have been that wrong... He was trying to bowl wide Yorkers in Asia cup and straight Yorkers today. Yes it did not come off, but the thinking behind it is still decent. 

He definitely has to work on the execution because those wides costed us a lot of runs.

Something big gotta give. It's not that they are losing matches, it's the manner of it all. Arrogance in choice of personnel, roles assigned (just coz they were once good at it doesn't mean they will always be. You need to assess and change), overdoing things like backing a player, experimenting. And least the fielding, this team for past many series hasn't showed the same zeal, there are no 'special' players in the field. If you just want to see the difference, see Kohli or Pandya getting to a ball vs others. They are not immune to mistakes but you can feel the extra drive, even if a slightly easy-going approach would have done they still go beyond. Chahal I feel shits a little every time balls come to him and his pants keep getting heavier and sticking to his legs compromising his mobility even more."

Third number indicates total runs given by bowler in that match. And the last number indicates number of wickets by bowler in that match.

Warner himself attributes IPL to his breakout sucess in Australia colours after 2011.

Hilfenhaus, Nannes, Bollinger also played for Australian white ball team and did well. 

Smith: Showcased his power hitting and all round abilities in early 2010s in the IPL before he became the test sensation. 

Maxwell: IPL 2014. Enough said.

9921|Cricket|xj7jtr|ip7ucz0|Naan6|1|1663693780.0|Is it the bowlers fault though? If you are a power play bowler and the captain still bowls you at the death I am not sure what you expect. Harshal is only picked for his death bowling. Injury is fair enough, but I am not sure what you would expect.

Also top scored in first 2 games albeit the pak innings was poor sr (but still not too shabby given the start and klol)

A tournament of good games is a smaller sample than 1 t20 where he does bad ig. Ur right."
9925|Cricket|xj7jtr|ip7q6s9|devil_21|1|1663692230.0|Indian bowlers have recently been carted for runs in the last overs but Australia can't bother to lose wickets now so it's pretty even I'd say. It would've been in India's favour if Bumrah was playing.

Punjabi players,Sure"
9928|Cricket|xj7jtr|ip7upsy|DilliKaLadka|1|1663693914.0|I would expect an experianced bowler not to bowl multiple wides and full tosses at death. That's what I expect from a bowler who is playing for India for almost a decade.

Also bro all Optic posts is getting really annoying now, we all get it why they possibly didn't make it and it's sad the core won't be together but bro same post every 5 mins üò©"

Australia were always winning"
